# Thermal-ALE-aHfO2-using-HF 
Origin of Enhanced Thermal Atomic Layer Etching of Amorphous HfO2

Each folder contains the CONTCAR, INCAR, KPOINTS and POTCAR for each system using VASP.5.4.4

The model of the bare surface of amorphous HfO2 is found in the folder aHfO2-bare.

The self-limiting product models 8O:16F, 10O:20F and 16O:32F for amorphous HfO2 are found in the respective folders.

For amorphous HfO2 three different configurations (A, B and C) were examined for the range of HF coverages using 2, 3, 4, 5 and 8 molecules per supercell and two configurations (A and B) for 16 molecules per supercell and one configuration for 28, 30, 32 and 34 molecules per supercell. The folders are named after their configurations for example, 2 HF on amorphous HfO2 at configuration B can be found in aHfO2-2HF-B
